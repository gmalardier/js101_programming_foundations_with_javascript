# The PEDAC Process

## P: Understanding the problem

- Establish the rules/ define the bounderies of the problem
  - Assess available information
  - Restate Explicit requirements
  - Identify Implecit requirements

- DON'T RUSH this step!
- Ask Questions (to yourself) to make sure you cover all implicit requirements.


## E: Examples and Test Cases

- Can confirm/ refute assumptions
- Help to answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and bounderies


## D: Data Structures

- Help reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at implementation level
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of the problem solving process
- Data structures closely linked to algorithm
  - Set of steps from input to output
    - Involves structuring data in a certain way


## A: Algorithms

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked t data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay Abstract/ hight-level
  - Avoid implementation details
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now


## C: Impleenting a solution in code

- Translating algorithm solution to code
- Think about algorithm in the context of the programing language
  - Languages features/ constraints
  - Characteristics of data structures
  - Built-in functions/ methods available to us
  - Syntax/ coding patterns
- Create test cases
- Code with intent
